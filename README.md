# Odin Landing Page Project

This is the first major project 'The Odin Project' has students complete.

It utilizes everything we've learned so far in HTML and CSS with a specific focus on flexbox.

This project helped me understand how to use the various properties associated with flexbox such as:

~ justify-content
~ align-items
~ flex-direction
~ flex-flow
~ gap
~ flex

I tried to do the CSS to take into account a changing resolution so the elements do adapt to different screen sizes, although a mobile view isn't the best.
